        <p>My grandmother taught me this recipe when I was younger.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 dozen eggs</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Sweet pickle relish</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>

            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a pot and place the eggs in the pot.</li>
            <li>Fill the pot with water.</li>
            <li>Boil the eggs for an hour.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot water off of the eggs and pour cold water on them. (This makes them easier to peel.)</li>
            <li>Peel all of the eggs.</li>
            <li>Slice each egg in half and place the yolk in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Lay the egg whites to the side.</li>
            <li>Grab the bowl with the egg yolks and smash them with a fork or spoon.</li>
            <li>Use a large spoon to add two scoops of mayonnaise to the yolks.</li>
            <li>Add one large spoon full of sweet pickle relish.</li>
            <li>Add a dash of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add a spoon full of sugar.</li>
            <li>Stir mixture together.</li>
            <li>If the consistancy of the mixture seems too think add a little more mayonnaise.(You don't want it to be too runny.)</li>
            <li>Taste a little bit of the mixture and see if there is anything that you need to adjust the taste of.</li>
            <li>Once you have the mixture ready, grab a spoon and spoon on the mixture in the egg whites.</li>
            <li>After you finish, take the cayenne pepper and sprikle over the eggs.</li>
        </ol>
